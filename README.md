This repo containes R script run_analysis.R, which processes Samsung Human Activity data to get a tidy dataset as output.

In order to get result, you should download this script in the same directory where the data are, and set your working direcotry to this path (using setwd()).

When finished, script creates file "tidy_dataset.txt" in the same dicrecotry.
